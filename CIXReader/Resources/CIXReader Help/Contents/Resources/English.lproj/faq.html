<p>Below are some of the more common questions asked about CIXReader:</p>
<h3>Spacebar doesn't always work</h3>
<p>This is a known bug and currently there's no workaround. Use the Next Unread command or the right arrow key to navigate unread messages instead.</p>
<h3>Arrow keys only work if the message list has the focus</h3>
<p>If you have the focus on the folder list or in the message pane then the right and left arrow keys will not work. Workaround is to click in the message list pane or use the Tab key to move the focus there then the arrow keys will start working again.</p>
<h3>Euro character is not correctly encoded</h3>
<p>If you compose and post a message containing the Euro currency character then it will appear rendered as garbage in the message pane. This is a known issue with the CIX server and will be addressed soon. There's no workaround other than to explicitly write the Euro character in text as "euro".</p>
<h3>Long URLs in messages that wrap do not work properly</h3>
<p>Users of Ameol or the Forums web may embed long URLs that are hard wrapped at the end of a fixed line length and when you click these links in CIXReader, the link is truncated when it is passed to the browser. The workaround is to copy and paste the whole URL into the browser manually.</p>
