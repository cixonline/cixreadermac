<p>
CIXReader is the new way to access CIX Forums from Mac OSX and Windows and read messages either off-line or on-line. Allows instant and draft postings, immediate access to whole topics, forums and automatically keeps in sync with the CIX Forums web interface.
</p>
<h3>Your Profile</h3>
<p>You should consider updating your profile so that other participants can learn more about you, your interests and areas of expertise. Select the Account command from the CIXReader menu and click the Edit button to fill out your profile details. You can keep some parts blank to protect your privacy. For example, you're not required to state your gender, location or e-mail address. Your full name can also be anything you want.</p>
<p>To update your profile picture, click the Edit button and drag and drop a new picture over the top of the existing one. Then click the Done button.</p>
<h3>Joining Forums</h3>
<p>To find a forum of interest, use the Directory. You can search for forums matching your interest by typing a search term into the Search box on the toolbar. Click the Join button to join the forum. If the forum is marked as closed then a request for admittance will be sent to the moderators and they will respond in due course. If you are automatically joined by the moderators to a closed forum then it will show up in your list of forums when CIXReader synchronises with CIX.</p>
<p>Some forums are private and do not show up in the Directory. Only the forum moderators can add you to a private forum.</p>
<h3>Resigning from Forums</h3>
<p>To resign from a forum and cease getting any new messages from that forum, use the Resign command in the Folder menu or click the forum name in the folder list and the Resign button on that page.</p>
<p>Resigning a forum does not remove copies of the messages in that forum from your CIXReader database. To delete those messages, use the Delete command from the Folder menu or the Delete button on the forum page. Note that deleting a forum from CIXReader does not remove it from CIX if you are the moderator of that forum. Also note that deleting a forum without first resigning it will cause the forum to come back next time CIXReader synchronises with CIX.</p>
<h3>Posting Etiquette</h3>
<p>CIX is a community. By participating in the community, you should be respectful of other participants and avoid being abusive. If you post a message that you feel is inappropriate then use the Withdraw command on the Message menu to withdraw that message. The contents of the message will be replaced by "Withdrawn by author".</p>
<p>Moderators exercise control over the messages posted to forums and will also withdraw any messages they feel is inappropriate. They are not required to notify the author that any message has been withdrawn though.</p>
<p>Although signatures are supported and permitted in forum messages, avoid making them unduly large as then they will distract from the message and annoy other participants who are forced to view the signature each time. If you want to provide additional contact details then place them in your profile instead.</p>
<h3>Sending Private Messages</h3>
<p>A private message (PMessage) is one sent to another CIX customer via CIX. To send a PMessage, select New PMessage from the File menu. You can only send a private message to one person at a time; multiple recipients are not yet supported.</p>
<h3>Changing Your Password</h3>
<p>If you need to change your CIX password, go to <a href="http://forums.cix.co.uk/secure/settings.aspx">your online settings page</a> and click the Change Password link.</p>
<p>Once you have changed your password, you will need to sign out of CIXReader via the Sign Out command on the File menu and then sign in with your new password.</p>
